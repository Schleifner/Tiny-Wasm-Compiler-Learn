# Introduction

This chapter will add global variable.

## Task to do

1. Design memory module of globals.
2. Implement global get/set instructions
3. Consider optimization, handle immutable and mutable globals with appropriate methods.
4. Pass [all test cases](./test).
5. Add test into CI pipeline.

## Doc

1. From this chapter, the memory module of Wasm is getting complex. For having a better overview of Wasm memory module and designing the JIT compiler compile time/runtime binary layout better, it's recommended to watch [this speech video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHj0AoUN82k").

## Learn target

1. Understand global variable and global get/set instruction of Wasm.
2. Extend the Compiled code with a runtime memory region.
